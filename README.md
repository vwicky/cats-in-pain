# 🐾 CatPainAI — Detecting Feline Pain with AI

**CatPainAI** is a smart web application that leverages artificial intelligence to detect signs of pain in cats from various inputs — including video, image, and text. Designed as part of a Data Science term paper, this project blends machine learning with a modern full-stack architecture for a meaningful cause: better animal welfare.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎥 Analyze videos, images, or descriptive text to assess feline pain levels
- 🧠 AI-driven model trained on multimodal data
- 🌐 Built with **React.js** (frontend) and **Express.js** (backend)
- 🧩 Structured using **Microservices** and **MVP (Model-View-Presenter)** architecture
- 📦 Scalable, modular, and production-ready

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js (Vite/CRA)
- **Backend:** Express.js (Node.js)
- **Architecture:** Microservices + MVP
- **AI/ML:** Custom model trained on feline behavior data

## 📚 Academic Context

This project is developed as part of a Data Science term paper to explore the integration of machine learning in real-world applications—especially those impacting animal health and care.

## 💡 Future Work

- Model improvements using more diverse datasets
- Real-time video stream analysis
- API endpoints for mobile integration
- User feedback loop for continuous learning
